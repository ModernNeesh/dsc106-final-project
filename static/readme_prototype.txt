So far, we have implemented the steps that allow a user to enter their Riot ID, region and tagline in order to get a line plot of their gold over time for different champions. This involves calling the Riot API to get the user's PUUID, which is then used to obtain their recent match data. From this match data, we then extract the data for the user's gold over time for the champions they've played in the last however many (for now 10) games. Then, we reformat that data and pass it to our line plot object, where we encode the time on the X-axis, the total gold on the Y axis, and the champions as the colors of the line. For now, due to API issues, we have instead chosen to have the "Search" button use a sample of previously obtained data from professional player Faker's recent games; however, it still displays the data in the same format as it would for anyone else using the website.

The most challenging part of designing the project will likely be animating the components to make everything look aesthetically pleasing. We don't have much experience with animation in Svelte, so it could be challenging for us to figure out how to make it work. Having to balance animation with the user's scrolling could cause some bugs. Additionally, we may still need to find a workaround to be able to continue with our project idea while also getting around certain issues we've been having with the API, which could prove troublesome.
